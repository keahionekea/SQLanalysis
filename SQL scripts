##After importing all of the data, there is one table that uploaded with duplicates. This query recreates the ratings table with no duplicates
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE restaurantproject.ratings_new AS
SELECT DISTINCT user_ID, overall_rating, restaurant_id, food_rating, service_rating
FROM `restaurantproject.ratings`;
ALTER TABLE restaurantproject.ratings_new
RENAME COLUMN user_id TO user_id_new;

##next query will replace 0,1,2 to a 1,2,3 scale for the ratings table
UPDATE `restaurantproject.ratings_new`
SET 
  service_rating = 
    CASE service_rating
      WHEN 0 THEN 1
      WHEN 1 THEN 2
      WHEN 2 THEN 3
      ELSE service_rating
    END,
  food_rating = 
    CASE food_rating
      WHEN 0 THEN 1
      WHEN 1 THEN 2
      WHEN 2 THEN 3
      ELSE food_rating
    END,
  overall_rating = 
    CASE overall_rating
      WHEN 0 THEN 1
      WHEN 1 THEN 2
      WHEN 2 THEN 3
      ELSE overall_rating
    END
WHERE restaurant_id IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT restaurant_id
  FROM `restaurantproject.ratings_new`
);

—-the next query will average the ratings given for each category of different customers to each restaurant—-
SELECT  distinct restaurant_id AS restaurant, 
ROUND(AVG(overall_rating)) AS overall_rating, 
ROUND(AVG(food_rating)) AS Food, 
ROUND(AVG(service_rating)) AS service 
FROM `restaurantreviews-379401.restaurantproject.ratings_new` 
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC, 3 DESC, 4 DESC
LIMIT 1000

I then created a new table which shows average ratings for each respective category 

##this query examines the relationship between overall rating and the price
SELECT re.price, av.overall_rating, COUNT(DISTINCT re.Restaurant_ID) AS businesses
FROM `restaurantreviews-379401.restaurantproject.restaurant` re LEFT JOIN
`restaurantproject.avg_ratings`av ON re.Restaurant_ID=av.restaurant
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1 ASC, 2 DESC


### this next query totals restaurants by city
select count(distinct restaurant_id) as businesses, City
from `restaurantreviews-379401.restaurantproject.restaurant`
group by  2
order by 1 DESC

### this next query shows restaurant ratings by location
SELECT count(distinct res.restaurant_id) as restaurants, av.overall_rating, res.City
FROM `restaurantreviews-379401.restaurantproject.restaurant` res
LEFT JOIN `restaurantproject.avg_ratings` av ON res.Restaurant_ID=av.restaurant
group by 2,3
order by 2 desc

##this finds out what the top food genre is for consumers—-
SELECT Count (distinct consumer_id) AS amtconsumers, prefered_cuisine 
FROM `restaurantreviews-379401.restaurantproject.consumer_preference` 
group by 2 
order by 1 DESC
LIMIT 1000

### this next query shows number of consumers by desired cuisine
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT consumer_id), prefered_cuisine
FROM `restaurantproject.consumer_preference`
WHERE prefered_cuisine IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 2
ORDER BY 1 DESC


##this dispalys the relationship between restaurant rating and cuisine relationship
SELECT ra.overall_rating, count(distinct cu.restaurant_id) AS business, cu.cuisine
 FROM `restaurantreviews-379401.restaurantproject.avg_ratings` ra
 LEFT JOIN `restaurantproject.cuisine`cu ON cu.restaurant_id=ra.restaurant
 WHERE cu.cuisine IS NOT NULL
 group by 1,3
 order by 1 DESC
 LIMIT 1000

##this query that i've formulated will give information on the top 10 rated restaurants such as the cuisine offered,
city it is located,the price of restaurant, and the name by joining 3 different tables together

SELECT rat.restaurant, rat.overall_rating,rat.food, rat.service, res.name, res.city, cui.cuisine, res.price
FROM`restaurantproject.avg_ratings` rat LEFT JOIN 
`restaurantreviews-379401.restaurantproject.restaurant` res ON rat.restaurant=res.Restaurant_ID 
LEFT JOIN `restaurantproject.cuisine` cui ON cui.Restaurant_ID=res.Restaurant_ID
WHERE cuI.cuisine IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 2 desc, 3 desc, 4 desc
LIMIT 10

##this query will do something very similar but with the worst rated restaurants
SELECT rat.restaurant, rat.overall_rating,rat.food, rat.service, res.name, res.city, cui.cuisine, res.price
FROM`restaurantproject.avg_ratings` rat LEFT JOIN 
`restaurantreviews-379401.restaurantproject.restaurant` res ON rat.restaurant=res.Restaurant_ID 
LEFT JOIN `restaurantproject.cuisine` cui ON cui.Restaurant_ID=res.Restaurant_ID
WHERE cuI.cuisine IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 2 ASC, 3 ASC, 4 ASC
LIMIT 10


##this next query shows totals consumers by age
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT consumer_id) AS people, age
FROM `restaurantproject.consumers`
GROUP BY  2
ORDER BY people DESC


### this next query totals consumers by occupation
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT consumer_id) AS people, occupation
FROM `restaurantproject.consumers`
GROUP BY  2
ORDER BY people DESC

### this next query shows total consumers by city
SELECT COUNT(DISTNICT consumer_id) as people, city
FROM `restaurantproject.consumers`
GROUP BY  2
ORDER BY people DESC

##marital status of consumers
SELECT Marital_Status, COUNT(DISTINCT Consumer_ID) AS people
FROM `restaurantreviews-379401.restaurantproject.consumers` 
WHERE marital_status IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1000

##family status of consumers
SELECT Children, COUNT(DISTINCT Consumer_ID) AS people
FROM `restaurantreviews-379401.restaurantproject.consumers` 
WHERE Children IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1000

##top occupation(student) and their preferred cuisine-
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT con.consumer_id) AS people, pref.prefered_cuisine, con.occupation
FROM `restaurantproject.consumers` con LEFT JOIN `restaurantproject.consumer_preference` pref
ON con.Consumer_ID=pref.consumer_id
GROUP BY 2,3
ORDER BY 1 DESC
LIMIT 10

### this next query shows how consumers travel
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT consumer_id) AS people, Transportation_Method
FROM `restaurantproject.consumers`
GROUP BY  2
ORDER BY people DESC

##What type of food restaurants are serving
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Restaurant_ID) AS restaurant, Cuisine
FROM `restaurantreviews-379401.restaurantproject.cuisine` 
GROUP BY 2  
ORDER BY 1 DESC
