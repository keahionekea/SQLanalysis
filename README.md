# SQLanalysis
The Scenario:

I have been given a dataset on a new up and coming business that wants to understand the demographic of restaurant consumers in Mexico. They are opening a franchise in several different cities, and have given me access to a database on consumer & restaurant information in Mexico. They have asked me to answer several questions with this dataset and want it done by the end of the day. Down below contains a list of questions for this scenario. 

For this project I will:

1.) Create a dataset on BigQuery 

3.) Create a schema to blueprint the relation between tables

4.) Use SQL to pull information from the database

5.) Visualize & record the results with Excel.

Questions we need to answer:
What does the age demographic look like?
What city holds most of these customers?
Where are most of the restaurants located?
What is the top occupation for consumers?
What is the average rating for restaurants by city?
What is the preferred food type for most customers?
What is the most common transportation method for these consumers?
Are these consumers single or married? Do they have children?
Where are most of these consumers located?
Can you find all the information on the top rated restaurants?

Marketing:
All of these questions will help for future marketing strategies. Answering these questions will help  understand the characteristics of consumers based on age, city, occupation, and the in-demand food type. Finding the common age group will help with comprehending the culture and the approach of marketing. Understanding the city of consumers will give a better idea of where to market. The occupation of consumers can assist to recognizing the culture of people we are marketing to (Are they students? Young adults working? Middle aged adults?). Insight on their form of transportation will give judgement on possible marketing ideas (i.e. advertisng in terminals).
